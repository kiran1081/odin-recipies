    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Laddus are primarily made from flour, fat (ghee/butter/oil) and sugar or jaggery. Laddus are often made of gram flour but can also be made with semolina. Sometimes ingredients such as chopped nuts and/or dried raisins can also be added. The type of ingredients used vary by recipe</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Cardamoms</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Magaz</li>
        <li>Ghee</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve sugar, saffron threads and water in a pan and keep it on the stove top.</li>
        <li>Cook the sugar solution till it reaches one thread consistency (check step 3 pic to see photo showing one thread consistency) and then switch off the flame. Keep the sugar solution aside.</li>
        <li>Make a smooth flowing batter of the gram flour/besan, crushed saffron and water. The batter should neither be thick nor thin. It should be a flowing batter without any lumps.</li>
        <li>Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. The oil has to be moderately hot. Take a perforated ladle/spoon. With your hands position the ladle above the oil.</li>
        <li>Take a large spoon of the besan batter and pour it on perforated ladle/spoon.</li>
        <li>For collecting the fried boondi use a large slotted spoon/jhara. Drain the oil very well after removing the boondi and then add them directly to the sugar syrup. Also note that the sugar syrup should be hot.</li>
        <li>Add the magaz/melon seeds and black cardamom seeds. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Apply some oil or ghee on your palms and shape the motichoor ladoo. The mixture would be warm when preparing the laddu. On cooling they become firm.</li>
        <li>You can garnish the motichoor ladoo with melon seeds/magaz or raisins. These motichur ladoo can also be refrigerated since they are not made from ghee.</li>
